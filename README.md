Follow the following to execute the program.
This program should to provide exact estimates for \tau_ken = 0.50. \\
To get other dependence levels, update the values for theta in (1, 4/3,  4) to produce the estimates for other dependence levels.
To estimate for other censoring levels, choose the value of gamma in U(0, \gamma) such that you get the corresponding censoring values.
For Weibull distribution for T1, update the likelihood as in the manuscript and repeat the above steps for transformed paramter values.
For Clayton copula, replace Gumbel copula with Clayton copula and repeat the above steps for transformed parameters values.
